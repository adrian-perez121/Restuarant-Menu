# Overall Thoughts

It was interesting to learn about webpack. To be honest I didn't find the 
content of this project interesting but I did find the idea of bundling interesting. In the previous projects I was wondering how to break things up into smaller pieces instead of having all the code in one large js file. This made things so much nicer.

Also wow, thats ALOT of packages!!!
